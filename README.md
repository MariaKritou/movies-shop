**RUNNING PROJECT:**<br>
You should run it on **Mozilla** or **Chrome**  (on microsoft edge UI has a few issues for now)<br>
To run the rpoject you just use: <br>
yarn install <br>
yarn start <br>
My api key is allready in the env file so no configuration is needed,<br>
if you want to use yours you can change it in the env file (REACT_APP_API).


**API CALL:**<br>
I used fetch but I wil try implementing it with Axios in the next phases

**BOOTSTRAP:**<br>
I used the vanilla bootstrap library V.5
